         <p>I am a Sophomore at Bob Jones University studying biblical counseling. I love working with kids and people.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy playing volleyball and hanging out with my friends. I have worked in a daycare and love teaching two year olds. I have worked at the Wilds as a counselor. I love competitions and losing isn't an option.

            I also enjoy eating ice cream, chocolate, and coffee. My favorite color is purple.
